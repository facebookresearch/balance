    The proportion of weights, normalized to sample size, that are above and below some numbers (E.g. 1,2,3,5,10 and their inverse: 1, 1/2, 1/3, etc.).
    This is similar to returning percentiles of the (normalized) weighted distribution. But instead of focusing on the 25th percentile, the median, etc,
    We focus instead on more easily interpretable weights values.

    For example, saying that some proportion of users had a weight of above 1 gives us an indication of how many users
    we got that we don't "loose" their value after using the weights. Saying which proportion of users had a weight below 1/10 tells us how many users
    had basically almost no contribution to the final analysis (after applying the weights).

    Note that below and above can overlap, be unordered, etc. The user is responsible for the order.

    Args:
        w (pd.Series): A pandas series of weights (float, non negative) values.
        below (Union[Tuple[float, ...], List[float], None], optional):
            values to check which proportion of normalized weights are *below* them.
            Using None returns None.
            Defaults to (1/10, 1/5, 1/3, 1/2, 1).
        above (Union[Tuple[float, ...], List[float], None], optional):
            values to check which proportion of normalized weights are *above* (or equal) to them.
            Using None returns None.
            Defaults to (1, 2, 3, 5, 10).
        return_as_series (bool, optional): If true returns one pd.Series of values.
            If False will return a dict with two pd.Series (one for below and one for above).
            Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        Union[pd.Series, Dict]:
        If return_as_series is True we get pd.Series with proportions of (normalized weights)
        that are below/above some numbers, the index indicates which threshold was checked
        (the values in the index are rounded up to 3 points for printing purposes).
        If return_as_series is False we get a dict with 'below' and 'above' with the relevant pd.Series (or None).
