    Figure out how much weight to give to each column name for ASMD averaging.
    This is meant for post-processing df produced from model_matrix that include
    one-hot categorical variables. This function helps to resolve the needed weight to add
    to columns after they are broken down by the one-hot encoding used in model_matrix.
    Each of these will count for 1/num_levels.
    It's OK to assume that variables with '[]' in the name are one-hot
    categoricals because model_matrix enforces it.

    Calculate the Absolute Standardized Mean Deviation (ASMD, a.k.a
    absolute standardized mean difference) between the columns of two DataFrames
    (or BalanceDFs).
    It uses weighted average and std for the calculations.
    This is the same as taking the absolute value of Cohen's d statistic,
    with a specific choice of the standard deviation (std).

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen's_d

    As opposed to Cohen's d, the current asmd implementation has several options of std calculation,
    see the arguments section for details.

    Unlike in R package {cobalt}, in the current implementation of asmd:
    - the absolute value is taken
    - un-represented levels of categorical variables are treated as missing,
      not as 0.
    - differences for categorical variables are also weighted by default

    The function omits columns that starts with the name "_is_na_"

    If column names of sample_df and target_df are different, it will only calculate asmd for
    the overlapping columns. The rest will be np.nan.
    The mean(asmd) will be calculated while treating the nan values as 0s.

    Args:
        sample_df (pd.DataFrame): source group of the asmd comparison
        target_df (pd.DataFrame): target group of the asmd comparison.
            The column names should be the same as the ones from sample_df.
        sample_weights (Union[ List, pd.Series, np.ndarray, ], optional): weights to use.
            The default is None.
            If no weights are passed (None), it will use an array of 1s.
        target_weights (Union[ List, pd.Series, np.ndarray, ], optional): weights to use.
            The default is None.
            If no weights are passed (None), it will use an array of 1s.
        std_type (Literal["target", "sample", "pooled"], optional):
            How the standard deviation should be calculated.
            The options are: "target", "sample" and "pooled". Defaults to "target".
            "target" means we use the std from the target population.
            "sample" means we use the std from the sample population.
            "pooled" means we use the simple arithmetic average of
                the variance from the sample and target population.
                We then take the square root of that value to get the pooled std.
                Notice that this is done while giving the same weight to both sources.
                I.e.: there is NO over/under weighting sample or target based on their
                respective sample sizes (in contrast to how pooled sd is calculated in
                Cohen's d statistic).
        aggregate_by_main_covar (bool):
            If to use :func:`_aggregate_asmd_by_main_covar` to aggregate (average) the asmd based on variable name.
            Default is False.
    Returns:
        pd.Series: a Series indexed on the names of the columns in the input DataFrames.
        The values (of type np.float64) are of the ASMD calculation.
        The last element is 'mean(asmd)', which is the average of the calculated ASMD values.
