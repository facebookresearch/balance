    Args:
        sample_df (pd.DataFrame): a dataframe representing the sample
        sample_weights (pd.Series): design weights for sample
        target_df (pd.DataFrame): a dataframe representing the target
        target_weights (pd.Series): design weights for target
        variables (Optional[List[str]], optional): list of variables to include in the model.
            If None all joint variables of sample_df and target_df are used
        transformations (str, optional): what transformations to apply to data before fitting the model.
            Default is "default" (see apply_transformations function)
        transformations_drop (bool, optional): whether the function should drop non-transformed variables.
            Default is True.
        strict_matching (bool, optional): whether to require all cells in the sample be in the target.
            Default is True. When False, a warning is provided and
            samples in cells not covered by the target are given weight 0.
    Raises:
        ValueError: _description_

    Returns:
