    Perform raking (using the iterative proportional fitting algorithm).

    Returns weights normalised to sum of target weights

    Arguments:
    sample_df --- (pandas dataframe) a dataframe representing the sample.
    sample_weights --- (pandas series) design weights for sample.
    target_df ---  (pandas dataframe) a dataframe representing the target.
    target_weights --- (pandas series) design weights for target.
    variables ---  (list of strings) list of variables to include in the model.
                   If None all joint variables of sample_df and target_df are used.
    transformations --- (dict) what transformations to apply to data before fitting the model.
                               Default is "default" (see apply_transformations function).
    na_action --- (string) what to do with NAs. Default is "add_indicator", which adds NaN as a
                  group (called "__NaN__") for each weighting variable (post-transformation);
                  "drop" removes rows with any missing values on any variable from both sample
                  and target.
    max_iteration --- (int) maximum number of iterations for iterative proportional fitting algorithm
    convergence_rate --- (float) convergence criteria; the maximum difference in proportions between
                          sample and target marginal distribution on any covariate in order
                          for algorithm to converge.
    rate_tolerance --- (float) convergence criteria; if convergence rate does not move more
                               than this amount than the algorithm is also considered to
                               have converged.

    Returns:
    A dictionary including:
    "weight" --- The weights for the sample.
    "model" --- parameters of the model: iterations (dataframe with iteration numbers and
                convergence rate information at all steps), converged (Flag with the output
                status: 0 for failure and 1 for success).

def _lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers.

    The least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the given numbers.
    In other words, it is the smallest multiple that the numbers have in common.
    The LCM is useful when you need to find a common denominator for fractions or synchronize repeating events with different intervals.

    For example, let's find the LCM of 4 and 6:

    The multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, ...
    The multiples of 6 are: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...
    The smallest multiple that both numbers have in common is 12, so the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12.

    The calculation is based on the property that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their LCM and GCD: a * b = LCM(a, b) * GCD(a, b).
    (proof: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/589299/1406)

    # For example, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6, since 6 is the largest integer that divides both 12 and 18 without leaving a remainder.
